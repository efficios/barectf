# Test Purpose
#
# This test configuration aims to verify that when the config property
# 'data-stream-type-id-field-type' is set to false, that the metadata
# file generated by barectf will not mention the  type id (in either the
# stream type description or in the event type descriptions).
#
# This makes sure that two common CTF trace readers (Babeltrace and
# Trace Compass) will be able to read the traces produced.
