# Tests that barectf generates a tracer which produces a valid trace on
# a little-endian system given a barectf 2 configuration having its
# `byte-order` trace type property set to `big-endian`.
#
# NOTE: This test does not validate that it runs on a little-endian
# system, but we can assume that that is the case since it is what the
# barectf tests currently require.
