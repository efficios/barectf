= Write a barectf YAML configuration file

A barectf configuration controls how barectf generates a tracer, for
example:

* What are the event record types for which to generate
  xref:tracing-funcs:index.adoc[tracing functions]?
+
In other words, what are the tracing function names and what are their
parameter types and names?

* Does a data stream have a clock source? If so, what's the clock source
  function's return C{nbsp}type?

* What's the identifier prefix for the C{nbsp}source code which barectf
  generates?
+
By default, a tracing function name could be
`+barectf_trace_my_stream_my_event()+`, but it can also be
`+my_company_trace_my_stream_my_event()+`.

barectf supports two methods to write a configuration:

. Create and assemble configuration objects with the barectf Python API
  (`barectf` package).

. Write a configuration in https://yaml.org/[YAML].

This section is about method{nbsp}2.

Read xref:yaml-primer.adoc[] to learn more about the YAML language.

A barectf YAML configuration document is a
xref:yaml:cfg-obj.adoc[configuration object].

[NOTE]
====
In a barectf YAML configuration, a xref:yaml-primer.adoc#scalar[null
value] always means to use the default value.

This is useful when taking into account the xref:include.adoc[partial
YAML file inclusion] or xref:ft-obj.adoc#inherit[field type object
inheritance] features: the overriding object can reset properties to
their default values.

[[stages]]
== Processing stages

barectf goes through the following stages when it processes a YAML
configuration:

. xref:include.adoc[Include], recursively, partial YAML files.

. Expand xref:trace-type-obj.adoc#ft-aliases-prop[field type aliases].
+
Replace every field type alias with its full xref:ft-obj.adoc[field type
object], recursively.

. Apply xref:ft-obj.adoc#inherit[field type object inheritance].

. Expand xref:trace-type-obj.adoc#ll-aliases-prop[log level aliases].
+
Replace every log level alias with its numeric value.

. Normalize property values.
+
If more than one value mean the same thing (for example,
xref:common-values.adoc#byte-order[`be` and
`big-endian`]), prefer one version.

A xref:cfg-obj.adoc[configuration object], after step{nbsp}5, is known
as an _effective configuration object_. The
xref:cli:usage.adoc#show-effective-configuration-command[`barectf show-effective-configuration`
CLI command] shows the effective version of a YAML configuration file.

[[tsdl-ident]]
== TSDL identifier

Many barectf YAML objects require that a given string key or value
be a valid TSDL (Trace Stream Description Language) identifier.

As per https://diamon.org/ctf/v1.8.3/[CTF{nbsp}1.8.3], a valid TSDL
identifier is any valid C{nbsp}identifier which is __not__ one of:

* `align`
* `callsite`
* `const`
* `char`
* `clock`
* `double`
* `enum`
* `env`
* `event`
* `floating_point`
* `float`
* `integer`
* `int`
* `long`
* `short`
* `signed`
* `stream`
* `string`
* `struct`
* `trace`
* `typealias`
* `typedef`
* `unsigned`
* `variant`
* `void`
* `_Bool`
* `_Complex`
* `_Imaginary`
