= How barectf works

barectf generates a CTF metadata stream and C{nbsp}source files
from a xref:yaml:index.adoc[**configuration**].

A barectf configuration specifies a xref:yaml:trace-type-obj.adoc[trace
type], xref:yaml:clk-type-obj.adoc[clock types],
xref:yaml:dst-obj.adoc[data stream types], xref:yaml:ert-obj.adoc[event
record types], and other options to generate the files.

With the `barectf` https://pypi.org/project/barectf/[Python package],
you build the barectf configuration programatically by assembling
configuration objects. This documentation is _not_ about the Python
package.

The xref:cli:index.adoc[`barectf` CLI tool] can read a
xref:yaml:index.adoc[YAML configuration file] and generate files out of
it.

[[generated-files]]
== Generated files

barectf generates the following files from a configuration:

[%autowidth.stretch, cols="d,a"]
|===
|File name |Description

|[[metadata]]`metadata`
|The CTF metadata stream file.

You'll need to place this file in a directory with the
xref:how-barectf-works:ctf-primer.adoc#ds[data stream] files which your
application will write through the generated tracer.

See xref:how-barectf-works:index.adoc[] to learn more.

|[[barectf.h]]`barectf.h`
|The generated tracer's public C{nbsp}header file.

This header contains the prototypes of the packet opening, packet
closing, and xref:tracing-funcs:index.adoc[tracing functions].

barectf generates one packet opening/closing function per configured
xref:yaml:dst-obj.adoc[data stream type] and one tracing function per
configured xref:yaml:ert-obj.adoc[event record type].

Your application and xref:platform:index.adoc[platforms] need to
include this file.

|`barectf-bitfield.h`
|Internal macros for the generated tracer (included by `barectf.c`).

|[[barectf.c]]`barectf.c`
|The generated tracer's C{nbsp}source code.
|===

Those file names assume that the configuration uses the default
xref:yaml:cfg-obj.adoc#prefix-prop[prefixes].

All C{nbsp}files are written in ANSI{nbsp}C.

[[ctf-data-stream-file-creation]]
== CTF data stream file creation

Your application calls the xref:tracing-funcs:index.adoc[tracing
functions] found in <<barectf.h,`barectf.h`>> to write
xref:ctf-primer.adoc#er[event records] to CTF
xref:ctf-primer.adoc#ds[data streams] of
xref:ctf-primer.adoc#pkt[packets]. Those CTF data streams and the
generated <<metadata,CTF metadata stream>> form a complete
xref:ctf-primer.adoc#trace[CTF trace].

How exactly the event timestamps are sourced and the CTF packets are
appended to some file or memory buffer is controlled by the
xref:platform:index.adoc[**platform**].

== Data flow

The typical data flow with barectf is:

[.width-80]
image::barectf-data-flow.svg[]

. barectf reads your xref:yaml:index.adoc[YAML configuration file].

. barectf <<generated-files,generates>> the CTF metadata stream file.

. barectf also generates the tracer's C{nbsp}files.

. After adding calls to the generated tracing functions in your
application code, you pass your application's C{nbsp}source file(s),
  xref:platform:index.adoc[platform]
  C{nbsp}source files, and the generated tracer's C{nbsp}source file to
  a xref:build:index.adoc[C{nbsp}compiler to create your final
  application].

. Your application <<ctf-data-stream-file-creation,creates CTF data
  stream files>> during its execution.
+
Those data stream files and the metadata stream file of step{nbsp}2 form
a complete xref:ctf-primer.adoc#trace[CTF trace].
