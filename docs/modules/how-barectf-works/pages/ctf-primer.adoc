= CTF primer

The https://diamon.org/ctf/[_**Common Trace Format**_] (CTF) is a binary
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_(software)[trace] format which is
designed to be very fast to write while offering many field types to
represent data.

A barectf configuration can use the following CTF field types:

* Unsigned/signed xref:yaml:int-ft-obj.adoc[integer] (1 to 64 bits).
* Unsigned/signed xref:yaml:enum-ft-obj.adoc[enumeration] (1 to
  64 bits).
* xref:yaml:real-ft-obj.adoc[Real] (single or double precision).
* Null-terminated xref:yaml:str-ft-obj.adoc[string].
* xref:yaml:struct-ft-obj.adoc[Structure] (zero or more named members).
* xref:yaml:static-array-ft-obj.adoc[Static array] of any field type
  except structure and dynamic array.
* xref:yaml:dyn-array-ft-obj.adoc[Dynamic array] of any field type
  except structure and dynamic array.

CTF makes it possible to describe the alignment and byte order of
integer, enumeration, and real fields.

A system which produces CTF streams is known as a _CTF producer_.

A system which consumes CTF streams is known as a _CTF consumer_.

[[trace]]
== CTF trace structure

A _**CTF trace**_ is exactly one metadata stream and one or more
<<ds,data streams>>:

[.width-50]
image::ctf-trace.svg[]

The metadata stream describes the trace's data streams with TSDL
(Trace Stream Description Language). On the file system, its file name
must be `metadata`.

The metadata stream describes things such as:

* The xref:yaml:clk-type-obj.adoc[type] of the data stream default clocks.
* The names of xref:yaml:ert-obj.adoc[event record types].
* The types of event record fields.
* The xref:yaml:trace-obj.adoc[trace]'s environment variables.

[[ds]]
=== Data stream

A _**CTF data stream**_ is a sequence of one or more data
<<pkt,packets>>:

[.width-100]
image::ctf-trace-all.svg[]

A xref:yaml:dst-obj.adoc[data stream type] describes data streams.

A packet contains one or more bytes of data.

Although a packet can contain padding itself, from the data stream's
point of view, there's no padding between packets.

A data stream can have, conceptually:

[[def-clk]]A default clock::
    Described by a xref:yaml:clk-type-obj.adoc[clock type] in the trace's
    metadata stream.
+
<<pkt,Packets>> and event records can contain snapshots, named
_timestamps_, of their data stream's clock.

[[disc-er-counter]]A counter of discarded event records::
    Indicates the number of event records which the generated tracer
    needed to discard for different reasons.
+
For example, the tracer discards an event record when it doesn't fit the
current packet and the back end is full (see
xref:platform:index.adoc[]).
+
A <<pkt,packet>> can contain a snapshot of this counter.

On the file system, a data stream file:

* Can have any name, except `metadata` and anything which begins with
  `.`.

* Must be in the same directory as the `metadata` file.

[[pkt]]
=== Packet

A _**CTF packet**_ is a part of a <<ds,data stream>>.

A packet contains, in this order:

. [.opt]##Optional##A header structure field, which contains:
+
** [.opt]##Optional##The CTF magic number.
+
See the trace type features object's
xref:yaml:trace-type-obj.adoc#magic-ft-prop[`magic-field-type`
property].

** [.opt]##Optional##A trace type
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier[UUID].
+
See the trace type object's
xref:yaml:trace-type-obj.adoc#uuid-prop[`uuid` property] and the
trace type features object's
xref:yaml:trace-type-obj.adoc#uuid-ft-prop[`uuid-field-type`
property].

** [.opt]##Optional##The numeric ID of the data stream type which, in the
   metadata stream, describes this packet's data stream.
+
See the trace type features object's
xref:yaml:trace-type-obj.adoc#dst-id-ft-prop[`data-stream-type-id-field-type`
property].

** [.opt]##Optional##The numeric ID of this packet's data stream.

. A context structure field, which contains:
+
** The packet's total size, in bits (always a multiple of{nbsp}8).
+
See the data stream type packet features object's
xref:yaml:dst-obj.adoc#total-size-ft-prop[`total-size-field-type`
property].

** The packet's content size, in bits.
+
See the data stream type packet features object's
xref:yaml:dst-obj.adoc#content-size-ft-prop[`content-size-field-type`
property].

** [.opt]##Optional##The packet's beginning timestamp.
+
See the data stream type packet features object's
xref:yaml:dst-obj.adoc#beginning-ts-ft-prop[`beginning-timestamp-field-type`
property].

** [.opt]##Optional##The packet's end timestamp.
+
See the data stream type packet features object's
xref:yaml:dst-obj.adoc#end-ts-ft-prop[`end-timestamp-field-type`
property].

** [.opt]##Optional##A discarded event record counter snapshot.
+
See the data stream type packet features object's
xref:yaml:dst-obj.adoc#disc-er-counter-snapshot-ft-prop[`discarded-event-records-counter-snapshot-field-type`
property].

** [.opt]##Optional##A packet sequence number.
** [.opt]##Optional##User fields.
+
See the data stream type object's
xref:yaml:dst-obj.adoc#pkt-ctx-ft-extra-members-prop[`packet-context-field-type-extra-members`
property].

. Zero or more <<er,event records>>.

A packet contains one or more bytes of data.

A packet can have padding (garbage data) after its last event record if
its total size is different from its content size.

[[er]]
=== Event record

A _**CTF event record**_ is the result of a tracer writing a
time-stamped record with user data when an event occurs during a user
application's execution.

An xref:yaml:ert-obj.adoc[event record type] describes event records.

An event record contains, in this order:

. [.opt]##Optional##A header structure field, which contains:
+
** [.opt]##Optional##The numeric ID of the event record type which, in the
   metadata stream, describes this event record.
+
See the data stream type event record features object's
xref:yaml:dst-obj.adoc#type-id-ft-prop[`type-id-field-type` property].

** [.opt]##Optional##A timestamp.
+
See the data stream type event record features object's
xref:yaml:dst-obj.adoc#ts-prop[`timestamp-field-type` property].

. [.opt]##Optional##A common context structure field, which contains
  user fields.
+
See the data stream type object's
xref:yaml:dst-obj.adoc#er-common-ctx-ft-prop[`event-record-common-context-field-type`
property].

. [.opt]##Optional##A specific context structure field, which contains user
  fields.
+
See the event record type object's
xref:yaml:ert-obj.adoc#spec-ctx-ft-prop[`specific-context-field-type`
property].

. [.opt]##Optional##A payload structure field, which contains user
  fields.
+
See the event record type object's
xref:yaml:ert-obj.adoc#payload-ft-prop[`payload-field-type` property].
